##  Show the local weather 

You can find the original solutions to this project on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Rumpel78/pen/KdVGPr) 
Sadly the used weather provider OpenWeatherMap does not allow SSL calls to their API, and because of the Cross-Domain-Policy calls must use SSL, the Site is not working anymore

This is the mostly the same implementation using forecast.io as weather provider and bing as geodata provider.

### Usage
Clone the repository

Run

    npm install

Then edit src/js/config.js with your api keys

Build and preview the site with

    gulp

Enjoy!
